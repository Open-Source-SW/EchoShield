# Motivation

In daily life, there are times when unwanted noise causes distress.

### Noise From Neighbors

Conflicts between neighbors caused by noise from neighbors have escalated into serious social issues, even leading to assaults and murders. In reality, many people suffer from excessive stress and nervous breakdowns due to the noise coming from adjacent units, separated by just a single wall.

### External Noise

External noises such as traffic sounds, car horns, subway noise, and construction sounds significantly degrade the quality of life and become a major source of stress.

### Noise from Electronic Devices

Noise from electronic devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners can feel even louder in small spaces, potentially causing stress. Particularly at night, the operational noise of such devices becomes more pronounced, adversely affecting sleep quality and even causing insomnia.

# Background

To solve such noise issues, we utilize the following.

### Destructive Interference

Destructive interference refers to the phenomenon where two waves with opposite phases meet and cancel each other out. In a noise cancellation system, a signal with the same amplitude but opposite phase as the noise signal is generated to eliminate the noise.

### Fourier Transform

To generate an anti-phase signal, the frequency and phase information of the noise must be analyzed, and Fourier Transform can be utilized for this purpose. Fourier Transform plays a crucial role in real-time analysis of the input analog noise signal and in generating the anti-phase signal based on this analysis.
