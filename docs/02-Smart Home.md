### Noise-Canceling System for the Bedroom

- **Problem Statement**: External noise (e.g., traffic noise, neighbor noise) or internal noise (e.g., refrigerator hum, air conditioner noise) in the bedroom reduces sleep quality and can lead to insomnia.

- **Noise Types**: Traffic noise through windows, Low-frequency vibration noise from the refrigerator

- **Solution**: Install noise-canceling devices near bedroom walls or windows to detect and emit canceling signals in real time as noise enters the bedroom. The system can monitor sleep patterns and operate during specific times or automatically activate when noise is detected.

### Noise-Canceling for Appliances and Home Devices

- **Problem Statement**:
  In studio apartments or small living spaces, noise from appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and microwaves is more noticeable, disrupting sleep or relaxation.

- **Noise Types**: Low-frequency noise from refrigerator motors, Fan noise from air conditioners, Fan noise from air purifiers

- **Solution**:
  Place IoT-enabled noise-canceling devices near appliances to detect noise in real time, analyze its characteristics, and generate counter-phase sound waves to cancel it out. Users can control noise intensity and cancellation strength through a mobile application.

### Noise-Canceling for Noise From Neighbors

- **Problem Statement**:
  Noise from upstairs, such as footsteps, furniture dragging, or children running, travels as structure-borne sound to lower floors, leading to disputes and discomfort among neighbors.

- **Noise Types**: Footsteps, Furniture dragging sounds, Children running sounds

- **Solution**:
  Install IoT-enabled noise-canceling pads on ceilings to analyze the frequency and phase of impact noises from upstairs and emit counter-phase sound waves in real-time to reduce the noise perceived downstairs. Additionally, the system can record the frequency of impact noise events to serve as evidence for resolving disputes between neighbors or enable timed noise reduction during specific hours.
